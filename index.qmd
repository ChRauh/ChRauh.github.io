:::{#hero-heading}

## Welcome! (Website under construction)
I am a senior researcher in the Global Governance unit of the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](http://www.wzb.eu/en) and a Professor for the 'Politics of Multilevel Governance' at the [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/wiso/fakultaet/fachgruppen/politik-und-verwaltungswissenschaft).
    
My research and teaching interests lie at the intersection of EU studies, comparative politics, and international relations. Focus areas include:
    
* Decision-making of and in the European Commission
* Public debates about European and international institutions
* The EU's role in the international order

My work combines solid theory with innovative empirical analysis. Luckily, this often involves the more immediate gratifications of a little programming, quantitative text analysis, and data visualization.

<!-- This website contains information on my professional bio, summarizes my academic record, provides replication data, and will once in a while offer some personal musings on politics and its scientific analysis. -->

Please do have a look and get in touch!
