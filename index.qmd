## Welcome! (Website under construction)

I am a senior researcher in the Global Governance unit of the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](http://www.wzb.eu/en) and a Professor for the 'Politics of Multilevel Governance' at the [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/wiso/fakultaet/fachgruppen/politik-und-verwaltungswissenschaft). 

My research and teaching interests lie broadly at the intersection of EU studies, international relations and comparative politics. Key focus areas include:

* Decision-making of and in the European Commission
* Public political debates about European and international institutions
* The EU's role in the international order

My work aims to combine solid theory with innovative empirical analysis. Luckily, this often involves the more immediate gratifications of a little programming, quantitative text analysis, and data visualization.

This website contains information on my professional bio, summarizes my academic record, provides replication data, and will once in a while offer some personal musings on politics and its scientific analysis.

Please do have a look and get in touch!
