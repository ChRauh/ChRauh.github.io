:::{#hero-heading}

## Welcome!
I am a senior researcher in the Global Governance unit of the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](http://www.wzb.eu/en) and a Professor for the 'Politics of Multilevel Governance' at the [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/wiso/fakultaet/fachgruppen/politik-und-verwaltungswissenschaft).
    
My research and teaching interests lie at the intersection of EU studies, comparative politics, and international relations. Focus areas include:
    
* <strong>Decision-making of and in the European Commission</strong>
* <strong>Public debates and communication about supranational politics</strong>
* <strong>The role of the European Union in the international order</strong>

Both my academic and consultancy work combines solid theoretical thinking with innovative empirical analysis. This often involves original digital <strong>data collection</strong>, advanced <strong>quantitative text analysis / NLP methods</strong>, and targeted <strong>data visualization</strong>.

<!-- This website contains information on my professional bio, summarizes my academic record, provides replication data, and will once in a while offer some personal musings on politics and its scientific analysis. -->

Please do have a look and get in touch!
