Been dancing around this since my early PhD days, but now I have finally build a scraper collecting comprehensive data on the legislative proposals of the European Commission. 

An initial analysis of this data is provided in the working paper "[An agenda-setter in decline?](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325828650_An_agenda-setter_in_decline_Legislative_activity_of_the_European_Commission_1985-2016)", but the descriptive overview below already contains quite some food for thought.
