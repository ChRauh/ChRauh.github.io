For my teaching on spatial / institutionalist analysis of EU decision-making, I followed the leads by Holger DÃ¶ring ([2013](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1465116512461189)) and plotted the aggregated positions of EU member state governments in the Council on two key dimensions of partisan conflict (extracted from the [Comparative Manifesto Database](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/)).
