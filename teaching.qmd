## Term papers and theses

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}

I am open to supervise your research projects in the form of term papers or BA/MA theses at the Chair of Politics of Multilevel Governance. Before reaching out, please inspect the guidelines below carefully: they sketch potential topic areas, define basic requirements, and outline my evaluation standards. If these parameters fit your project, I look forward to learning about your plans!
