Initially designed as an independent, expertise-driven secretariat to facilitate efficient international cooperation, the Commission now wields more political competences than almost any other international bureaucracy. Simultaneously, it faces significant constraints from national governments, the European Parliament, and increasingly contentious public debates on inter- and supranational decision-making. How does the Commission navigate these tensions? Can it continue to generate effective solutions to cross-national challenges in an increasingly politicized environment?\nThis seminar aims to provide Master students with current perspectives on the functioning of this crucial supranational institution. The first block reviews the various roles assigned to the European Commission by theories of European integration, international organization, and public administration. The second block delves into the Commission’s formal competences, organizational structure, and staffing patterns in light of these roles. Building on this foundation, the third and most extensive block examines recent studies on the Commission’s political and administrative behavior, specifically its legislative influence, its agenda-setting abilities, its responsiveness to contentious public debates, and its public communication.\nAlong this route, the seminar will equip students with an encompassing perspective on a key supranational institution, provides them with analytical tools to grasp the Commission’s behavior in contemporary European politics, and offers them different theoretical lenses and empirical research approaches to study this and comparable institutions more generally."

What drives the underlying public attention to international politics and how do supra- and international institutions respond?\nThis seminar builds on a current research agenda and provides participants with analytical tools to analyze the public communication of and about the European Union and other international organizations, such as the IMF or the World Bank for example. It proceeds in three steps. First, we review key arguments on the public politicization of international institutions from different fields of political science. Second, we read and discuss empirical studies on the frequency, timing, content, and style of political communication about international institutions in domestic media, parliamentary debates, or election campaigns. Third, we will study whether and how the communication efforts of international institutions themselves live up to the increasing public politicization they face.\nThe seminar addresses advanced B.A. students who want to deepen their knowledge on contemporary European and international multilevel governance (possibly in preparation for a thesis in the above mentioned fields), who are willing to engage in both the substantial and methodological issues of the literature, and who are prepared to engage in mutual learning during the seminar. Assignments include a presentation or summary of a scholarly article and a term paper applying one of the discussed aspects to a freely chosen empirical issue of international politics."

Then we will focus on the strength and weaknesses of individual human-coding and (semi-)automated approaches to content analysis.\nWhile the first two sessions offer general discussions of the methodological fundamentals of content analyses, the later sessions present the intuition, exemplary applications and software tools of specific individual approaches to extract systematic information from texts.\nOn this basis, we will then commonly discuss how these methods relate to your research projects. Each participant is asked to prepare a 7-10 mins presentation on his/her project roughly structured around the following for points:\n\nWhat is your research question (and what are possible answers)?\nWhy may content analysis help you to answer this question?\nWhat are the relevant documents/texts and where can you get them from?\nHow would you extract the information you need from these texts?\n\nNote that these presentations do not have to be highly polished – the may range from preliminary results, initial drafts of a research design, to very initial ideas or options you might have with regard to the four structuring questions.

How do national parliaments perform their legislative, control, and legitimating functions in the context of multi-level governance? The seminar exposes the participants to contemporary and empirically rigorous research on the institutional capacities and the partisan incentives of parliamentary actors to engage with international politics.\nThe first, primarily theoretical block discusses and links classical literature on parliamentary functions on the one hand and on the relationships between domestic and international politics on the other. The second and largest block focusses on the role of national parliaments in European integration. We will analyse whether and how national parliaments have improved their institutional role in European affairs over time and member states but we will also study varying partisan incentives to exploit this capacity. The third and final block applies these insights to selected, particularly internationalized policy fields, most notably trade and security.\nThe course addresses advanced BA and MA students who already control some knowledge on European and international multilevel governance, who are willing to engage in both the substantial and methodological issues of the literature to be read, and who are prepared to actively participate during the sessions. Besides regular participation and reading, assignments include at least one presentation of a scholarly article and a term paper that applies one of the discussed aspects to a freely chosen empirical issue of supra- or international governance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll details on course organization, assignments, literature and individual sessions are provided in the syllabus below."

The seminar exposes the participants to contemporary and empirically rigorous research on the institutional capacities and the partisan incentives of parliamentary actors to engage with international politics.\nThe first, primarily theoretical block discusses and links classical literature on parliamentary functions on the one hand and on the relationships between domestic and international politics on the other. The second and largest block focusses on the role of national parliaments in European integration. We will analyse whether and how national parliaments have improved their institutional role in European affairs over time and member states but we will also study varying partisan incentives to exploit this capacity. The third and final block applies these insights to selected, particularly internationalized policy fields, most notably trade and security.\nThe course addresses advanced BA and MA students who already control some knowledge on European and international multilevel governance, who are willing to engage in both the substantial and methodological issues of the literature to be read, and who are prepared to actively participate during the sessions. Besides regular participation and reading, assignments include at least one presentation of a scholarly article and a term paper that applies one of the discussed aspects to a freely chosen empirical issue of supra- or international governance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll details on course organization, assignments, literature and individual sessions are provided in the syllabus below."

    "title": "Why so much fuss about one supranational official?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post appeared firstly on the Orders beyond Borders blog of the WZB Global Governance department.\nFour weeks ago, Jean Claude Juncker appointed Martin Selmayr as the European Commission’s future administrative head – the so-called Secretary-General. This move came as a surprise, entered the respective Commission meeting agenda only last minute, and sidestepped the usual procedure for internal promotions. This staffing choice made it to various national news outlets (Le Monde, Zeit Online, and The Irish Times, to name a few), significantly increased online searches, created a veritable Twitter storm, and ultimately culminated into a rather confrontational debate in the European Parliament. For a public servant job in Brussels’ Berlaymont building, this is an unusual amount of public spotlight. Why so much fuss about one supranational official?\nClearly, Selmayr has made a controversial name for himself in the Brussels scene – not the least in his role as the current Chef de Cabinet, and thus major political advisor of the Commission President. And, of course, political context matters: The European Commission currently struggles to fight democratic backsliding in several EU member states while it itself is attacked for a lack of democracy by populist parties mobilising against the EU. In this setting, the allegations of patronage surrounding Selmayr’s appointment provide welcomed ammunition for the Commission’s trigger-happy critics.\nBut this is only part of the story. Outspokenly Europhile members of the European Parliament reacted furiously to this seemingly administrative staffing move. This, I argue, is driven by the fact that the post of the Commission’s Secretary-General carries much more political clout than its primarily administrative denomination suggests. Three key insights from research into EU decision making underline this.\nFirst, as an institution, the European Commission is torn between being a purely administrative bureaucracy and a decidedly political executive – a tension that is reflected not only among European Commissioners but also among the administrative echelons of Europe’s central bureaucracy. Most importantly, the Commission has both informal and formal means to influence the legislative agenda of the EU. Informally, the Commission can, for example, prepare the ground for future legislation by framing specific issues as European, by launching investigations of the European Court of Justice, by conducting its own studies and stakeholder consultations, or by selectively querying public opinion. Formally, the Commission holds the monopoly of legislative initiative in many areas of European competence, meaning that the Council of Ministers or the European Parliament cannot act without a law proposal elaborated by the Commission. This grants the Commission an institutional head start into selecting the rules and policy options that are proposed for regulating European societies.\nSecond, the ways in which diverging interests are coordinated inside the European Commission affect the policies the institution finally proposes for Europe. Especially in this regard, the Commission’s Secretariat-General has considerable power. It is, for example, exactly the Commission department Martin Selmayr now heads that signs responsible for the Commission’s five-year legislative programme. This responsibility yields influence on whether, which, and when other Directorates-General of the Commission can formulate European policy on specific topics. And once these departments actually draft legislations, the Secretariat-General controls the so-called ‘upstream coordination’, steering, for instance, which other departments get consulted internally or managing the impact assessments of different policy options.\nThird, the Secretariat-General has a very long time horizon, which exceeds the usual office term of most European Commissioners, Parliamentarians, or member state representatives. In fact, in its sixty-one-year history, the European Commission has only had six Secretaries-General – excluding Selmayr’s recently started term – amounting to an average of more than ten years in office. While elected politicians come and go, the Secretary-General has the resources and the time to consistently work on legislative issues, set precedents, and built political momentum over time. This yields additional strategic advantages in shaping the contents of European law.\nThese three insights together lead to one conclusion: The post of the Commission’s Secretary-General is much more than a managerial position. Instead, it comes with significant political influence over legislative decision making in the EU. Against this political clout, a controversial debate on how and by whom this post should be filled is actually not very surprising. But against the public politicisation of the EU, it is surprising that the Commission (apparently) thought that evading such a debate ex ante was a smart idea."

    "text": "Dieser Beitrag erschien zuerst in den WZB Mitteilungen 183.\nDemokratie braucht Demokratinnen und Demokraten. Das Ideal der kollektiven Selbstbestimmung lässt sich nur realisieren, wenn die Bürger:innen hinter ihren demokratischen Rechten und den darauf aufbauenden Entscheidungsverfahren stehen und sie im Notfall auch verteidigen. Deshalb ist es zunächst beruhigend, dass es in Umfragen wie dem World Values Survey große Zustimmung zur Aussage gibt, dass Demokratie die beste Staatsform sei.\nAllerdings bleibt dabei offen, wie weit der Rückhalt für die Demokratie tatsächlich reicht. Die Autokratisierungstendenzen und das Erstarken radikal-rechter Parteien in vielen Ländern bieten Anlass zur Skepsis. Möglicherweise verknüpfen die Bürger:innen sehr unterschiedliche Ideen mit dem abstrakten Ideal der Demokratie. Konkret könnten erhebliche Differenzen darin bestehen, welche individuellen Rechte und kollektiven Entscheidungsverfahren die Bürger:innen für wirklich verteidigungswürdig halten. Und was, wenn es sich bei der in Umfragen artikulierten Unterstützung für die Demokratie nur um eine Art „Schönwetterphänomen“ handelt – und nicht um tiefsitzende Überzeugungen, die auch unter widrigen Umständen Bestand haben?\nTatsächlich sind die heute drängendsten gesellschaftlichen Probleme nicht immer leicht mit dem Ideal der kollektiven Selbstbestimmung zu vereinbaren. So stellen akute Krisen wie der Ausbruch der Covid-19-Pandemie eine Herausforderung für oftmals langwierige demokratische Meinungsbildungsprozesse und Entscheidungsverfahren dar. Demokratische Mitsprache und Aushandlung könnten auch dann als wenig geeignet betrachtet werden, wenn langfristige Ziele mit kurzfristigen Interessen kollidieren – wie etwa beim Klimawandel. Zudem könnten Zweifel an der Zweckmäßigkeit national verfasster demokratischer Rechte und Verfahren aufkommen, weil viele der aktuellen Herausforderungen transnationalen Charakter haben, neben Pandemie und Klimawandel z.B. auch die Migration. Und schließlich sind all diese gesellschaftlichen Herausforderungen durch hohe Komplexität und Unsicherheit gekennzeichnet, was die demokratische Willensbildung für die einzelnen Bürger:innen, aber auch für die Gesellschaft als Ganzes, kompliziert und kostenträchtig macht.\nDie politische Theorie hat vor diesem Hintergrund wieder und wieder betont, dass sich der tatsächliche Rückhalt für die Demokratie erst in Krisenzeiten zeigt, wenn solche Zielkonflikte sichtbar werden. Wie weit reicht also der Rückhalt der Bürger:innen im Kontext großer gesellschaftlicher Herausforderungen - wenn sie die Demokratie nicht nur grundsätzlich befürworten, sondern demokratische Rechte und Entscheidungsverfahren gegen Alternativen abwägen müssen?\nDieser Frage sind wir auf dem Höhepunkt der Delta-Welle der Covid-19-Pandemie im November 2021 mit einer breit angelegten vergleichenden Bevölkerungsumfrage nachgegangen. Unsere Befragten hatten zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits über anderthalb Jahre weitreichende Regierungsmaßnahmen zur Eindämmung des Virus erlebt. Einschränkungen individueller Rechte und Diskussionen über die (Un-)Angemessenheit verschiedener Entscheidungsverfahren waren damit mehr als nur rein hypothetische Szenarien. Mit Unterstützung des Exzellenzclusters „Contestations of the Liberal Script (SCRIPTS)“ konnten wir je 1.500 wahlberechtigte Befragte in Deutschland, Japan, Polen, Spanien, Südkorea und Ungarn mit zwei innovativen Umfrageexperimenten konfrontieren, die die angesprochenen Zielkonflikte explizit modellierten.\nIm ersten Experiment wurden die Befragten wiederholt gebeten, sich zwischen zwei fiktiven, aber realistischen Maßnahmenpaketen zur Eindämmung einer potenziell tödlichen Atemwegserkrankung zu entscheiden. Diese Maßnahmenpakete adressierten stets die gleichen privaten und politischen Rechte der Befragten. Welche davon eingeschränkt werden sollten und welche nicht, wurde jedoch nach dem Zufallsprinzip variiert. Mit Hilfe dieses sogenannten Conjoint-Designs kann statistisch ermittelt werden, wie sich die die verschiedenen Eingriffe in private und politische Rechte der Bürger:innen auf ihre Unterstützung für die Maßnahmenpakete der Regierung auswirken.\nUnsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Bürger:innen sehr sensibel auf Einschränkungen ihrer privaten Rechte reagieren. Insbesondere Restriktionen bezüglich des Verlassens der eigenen Wohnung, Schulschließungen, aber auch Beschränkungen von Einkaufsmöglichkeiten jenseits des täglichen Bedarfs führten zu starker Ablehnung. Beschränkungen des internationalen Reiseverkehrs oder Ermöglichung von Arbeit im Homeoffice führten tendenziell zur stärkeren Unterstützung eines Maßnahmenpakets.\nIm Gegensatz dazu hatten Einschränkungen demokratischer Rechte praktisch keinen Einfluss. Konkret thematisierte unser Experiment eine Verschiebung von Wahlen, ein Verbot von Demonstrationen sowie eine stärkere Kontrolle der Medien durch die Regierung. Keiner dieser drei Faktoren hatte einen nennenswerten Effekt darauf, ob die Bürger:innen ein Maßnahmenpaket befürworteten oder ablehnten. Dieses Muster zeigte sich, von geringfügigen Abweichungen abgesehen, in allen sechs untersuchten Ländern.\nEs ist nicht überraschend, dass sich die Befragten in erster Linie um ihre persönlichen Freiheiten sorgen. Mit Blick auf das demokratische Ideal ist es aber schon bemerkenswert, dass die Einschränkungen ihrer politischen Rechte überhaupt keine Rolle zu spielen scheinen. Das Experiment scheint eine weitgehende Indifferenz der Bürger:innen gegenüber Einschränkungen ihrer demokratischen Rechte in Krisensituationen zu belegen.\nWährend das erste Experiment auf die Ergebnisse von Entscheidungsprozessen fokussiert war, standen in unserem zweiten Experiment Verfahren zur Entscheidungsfindung im Mittelpunkt. Einleitend wurde dabei zunächst der Gegenstand des Regierungshandelns nach dem Zufallsprinzip variiert. Für ein Drittel der Befragten ging es um „große gesellschaftliche Herausforderungen wie die Corona-Pandemie“, für ein weiteres Drittel um „große gesellschaftliche Herausforderungen wie den Klimawandel“, für das letzte Drittel schließlich um „große gesellschaftliche Herausforderungen“ ohne weitere Spezifizierung.\nDie Befragten wurden sodann gebeten, verschiedene Ansätze zur Entscheidungsfindung zu vergleichen und zu priorisieren, darunter das Einbeziehen der Bevölkerungsmeinung über Umfragen oder Referenden, aber auch parlamentarische Abstimmungen oder das Anstreben eines breiten parteipolitischen Konsenses als typische Verfahren der repräsentativen Demokratie. Weitere Optionen waren der Rückgriff auf Expert:innenmeinungen, die Berücksichtigung von Wirtschaftsinteressen, internationale Koordination oder schlicht und einfach ein möglichst schnelles Regierungshandeln.\nWir verwendeten dazu ein sogenanntes Best-Worst-Skalierungsverfahren, bei dem sich die Befragten wiederholt zwischen den unterschiedlichen Verfahrenslogiken entscheiden mussten. Aus der Summe dieser Entscheidungen lassen sich nun die durchschnittlichen Präferenzordnungen unserer Befragten ermitteln: Wir können also sehen, wie wichtig ihnen dezidiert demokratische Verfahren im Vergleich zu anderen Logiken der Entscheidungsfindung sind. Die über alle sechs Länder gemittelten Ergebnisse dieses Experiments fallen in den sechs recht unterschiedlichen Ländern überraschend ähnlich aus.\nGroße Übereinstimmung, unabhängig von der Art der gesellschaftlichen Herausforderung, besteht in einem Punkt: Die Konsultation von Expert:innen ist für die Bürger:innen der weitaus wichtigste Ansatz zur Entscheidungsfindung. Die Berücksichtigung von Wirtschaftsinteressen, die direkte Befragung der Bevölkerung durch Referenden oder Umfragen und ein schnelles Handeln folgen mit einigem Abstand auf den weiteren Plätzen. Dabei zeigen sich unmittelbar plausible Unterschiede je nach Art der gesellschaftlichen Herausforderung: Zügiges Regierungshandeln wird vor allem angesichts einer pandemischen Notlage befürwortet. Die Berücksichtigung der öffentlichen Meinung wird interessanterweise vor allem dann favorisiert, wenn die Art der Herausforderung nicht genauer definiert wird. Im Mittel sind den Befragten direkt-demokratische Entscheidungslogiken also ungefähr genauso wichtig wie wirtschaftliche Interessen oder schnelle Entscheidungen allein durch die Exekutive.\nAuf den weiteren Plätzen landen die Betonung internationaler Koordination, wobei ihr im beim Klimawandel spürbar größere Bedeutung beigemessen wird, und ganz hinten schließlich die beiden repräsentativ-demokratischen Ansätze: das Anstreben eines parteipolitischen Konsenses und die Legitimierung kollektiver Entscheidungen durch parlamentarische Abstimmungen.\nDabei gibt es, wie bereits diskutiert, zwar einige Unterschiede je nach Art der gesellschaftlichen Herausforderung, zwei zentrale Befunde sind jedoch für alle drei Gruppen gleich: Experteninput wird immer als am wichtigsten gesehen, während parlamentarische Abstimmungen immer am hinteren Ende der Skala landen.\nDie deutlich stärkeren Präferenzen für expert:innen- und wirtschaftsorientiertes, zum Teil auch für schnelles Handeln der Regierung stehen durchaus im Widerspruch zum Prinzip der demokratischen Kontrolle durch gleiche und angemessene Beteiligung aller Bürger:innen. Wenn sie gezwungen sind, zwischen unterschiedlichen Verfahren zu entscheiden, bevorzugen die Befragten offenbar die Stärkung von Akteuren, die ihnen gegenüber nicht durch demokratische Mechanismen rechenschaftspflichtig sind. Das heißt nicht, dass eine direkte Beteiligung als komplett unwichtig angesehen wird, aber entsprechende Verfahren rangieren im Schnitt etwa gleichauf mit wirtschaftlichen Interessen oder schnellen Entscheidungen durch die Exekutive. Bemerkenswert ist aber vor allem, dass Schlüsselmechanismen der repräsentativen Demokratie, die Berufung auf Parteien und gewählte parlamentarische Vertreter:innen, als am unwichtigsten angesehen werden. Auch dieses Muster zeigt sich in allen sechs Ländern. Diese Präferenzrangfolge lässt sich kaum mit einem besonders starken Rückhalt für das demokratische Ideal der kollektiven Selbstbestimmung in Einklang bringen.\nIn der Gesamtschau lassen unsere Befunde zwei mögliche Interpretationen zum Rückhalt für die Demokratie in Krisenzeiten zu. Aus pragmatischer Sicht ließe sich durchaus optimistisch argumentieren, dass die befragten Bürger:innen sehr rational auf die Zielkonflikte zwischen dem Schutz demokratischer Rechte und Entscheidungsverfahren einerseits und der Bewältigung komplexer Herausforderungen wie Pandemien und Klimawandel andererseits blicken. Die starken Präferenzen für expert:innenengeleitete Entscheidungsfindung oder die Betonung internationaler Koordination bei der Bewältigung des Klimawandels stehen dabei im Einklang mit der politikwissenschaftlichen Literatur, die eine Zunahme “technokratischer Präferenzen“ konstatiert.\nAus demokratietheoretischer Sicht lassen sich unsere Befunde aber auch pessimistischer als Ausdruck eines mangelnden Rückhalts für die Demokratie interpretieren. Bürger:innen scheinen ihre politischen Rechte und den damit einhergehenden Einfluss bei schwierigen Herausforderungen nicht nur weniger konsequent als andere Rechte zu verteidigen; sie scheinen ihre indirekten (Mit-)Entscheidungskompetenzen auch bereitwillig an die Exekutive oder an Expert:innen abzutreten. Dies kann durchaus Anlass zur Sorge geben: Die begrenzte Unterstützung zentraler demokratischer Rechte und Prinzipien gerade in Krisenzeiten kann dazu führen, dass demokratische Rechenschaftspflichten der Regierung ausgehöhlt werden, nicht demokratisch legitimierte Akteure an Einfluss gewinnen und Gelegenheiten für eine dauerhafte Schwächung demokratischer Mechanismen entstehen.\nIn jedem Fall sprechen die Ergebnisse beider Experimente dafür, dass man sich nicht auf der allgemeinen Zustimmung zu abstrakten Idealen der Demokratie in Bevölkerungsumfragen ausruhen sollte. Es ist vielmehr wichtig, die Sichtweisen der Bürger:innen auf die komplexen, mehrdimensionalen Zielkonflikte in der demokratischen Regierungsführung unserer Gesellschaften zu verstehen. Empirische Ansätze, die Befragte zu einer klaren Priorisierung von Zielen und Prinzipien veranlassen, erscheinen aussagekräftiger als allgemeine Fragen zu demokratischen Einstellungen. Angesichts der Häufigkeit von nationalen, regionalen und globalen Krisensituationen sowie der zunehmenden Konkurrenz durch autoritäre Regime scheint es relevanter denn je zu verstehen, wie weiter der der Rückhalt der Bürger:innen für die Demokratie wirklich reicht."

    "text": "This post originally appeared on the (now defunct) Orders Beyond Borders blog. A German version is archived here.\nPublic support for the European integration project can hardly be treated as given any more. Public opinion on the EU fluctuates heavily. Critical media reporting from and about Brussels increases. And Eurosceptic campaigns and parties flourish in most EU member states.\nBoth the public and the academic debates concentrate primarily on the strategies of the challenging actors in this regard. Yet, politicization is an interactive process. For the evolution of the debate about Europe, the political signals of the established actors are at least equally decisive.\nFor these actors – especially from governing or major opposition parties – political science mainly expects reluctant communication about European integration. The political ‘mainstream’ is expected to avoid internal partisan conflict on the EU while trying not to endanger supranational compromises. Thus clear political signals on the EU should be rare. Against surging public politicisation, however, this strategy is risky: a lack of competition about political alternatives within Europe may quickly lead to more fundamental opposition against Europe (for versions of this argument see here, here, here, or here). So, how do established political actors actually communicate on European integration?\nIn an earlier study, Pieter De Wilde and I analysed the supply of EU debate in four national parliaments across more than 20 years. In these key institutions of representative democracy mainly governing parties speak about the EU. Independent from their partisan colours, established opposition parties offer systematically less debate about Europe in contrast. What is worse, the parliamentary supply of political signals about the EU falters when domestic elections are close and when public EU opinion deteriorates. These findings bolster the view that conflict defusion is the dominant EU communication strategy of established political representatives.\nThis is emphasized further if one considers the quality of these political signals. For the conference ‘What stories does Europe tell?’ I extracted three-sentence windows around literal references to the EU or European integration from almost two million parliamentary speeches in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK. For each of these text bits I then calculated the Flesh Reading Ease Score and compared it to a 1% random sample of parliamentary speeches from each country (a total of 19,260 speeches; data source: ParlSpeech).\nThe score presents a weighted index of sentence and term length. It is typically used in psycholinguistics to quantify the cognitive investment needed to decipher a text. With this instrument we can at least roughly assess how easily voters can understand political communication about Europe as compared to a random political speech.\n\nCaution is warranted when interpreting these scores in absolute terms or comparing them across languages. But in relative terms the findings are unequivocally clear: In the more than 20 years of parliamentary discourse across all four covered countries, the language around European integration messages is much harder to decipher than the average political speech. When it comes to the EU, in other words, voters receive much less clear political signals.\nOne might argue that EU topics are just more complex per se. Yet, for two reasons I consider this implausible. First, there are also national topics of high technical complexity – think of tax legislation or social insurance systems, for example. From a purely factual perspective our comparative sample should thus not be as systematically different as it is. Second, it is plausible that domestic MPs approach communication professionally. Especially in prepared speeches they should be able to express complex topics in short sentences with understandable terminology as well. Thus also for these findings we can assume that the language on Europe is intentionally diffuse for strategic reasons.\nThis strategic perspective is furthermore bolstered by a recent study with Bart Bes and Martijn Schoonvelde. We analysed around 9,000 public speeches of national leaders and European Commissioners during the onset of the Eurocrisis 2007-2015. One key finding: The complexity of their communication on European integration increases when domestic public EU opinion deteriorates in conjunction with soaring Eurosceptic parties. Also in this analysis, thus, established political actors apparently try to defuse European integration conflicts rather than sending clear stances.\nThis faint-hearted communication might be understandable against short-term considerations. Yet, in the context of an intense public EU politicisation one may doubt whether this strategy is successful in the long term. Rhetorically obfuscating positions on Europe – instead of pro-actively defending and justifying them – plays well into the hands of those trying to sway voters by all too easy narratives of an elite collusion that is out of touch with the ordinary European citizen."

    "text": "In my opinion the outcome of the British referendum is wrong on so many accounts. Personally, some of my most formative European experiences took place on British soil. Good friends as well as dear colleagues live and work in the UK. The ‘Leave’ majority has upset their way of living and it shattered my beliefs about many future opportunities for me and my family. But beyond these personal motives, I think that the referendum outcome is wrong because many if not most contemporary societal challenges require a decent level of economic and political cooperation across national borders.\nDon’t get me wrong, I am not one of those claiming that the EU constantly surfs the Pareto frontier distributing nothing but goodies for everybody who is smart enough to recognize them. Rather, my academic writing has hopefully helped to clarify that cooperation across borders comes with institutions that do make intrinsically political choices (see e.g. here, hereor here). Like in national capitals, collective decision-making in Brussels will at times benefit some while disadvantaging others. Thus it is true that the sacked worker in Birmingham, the frustrated fisherman in Cornwall, or the NHS-dependent old lady in Brighton can put forward pretty rational arguments against key EU policies. And it is far from trivial to adequately weigh their justified skepticism against the equally justified EU defenses that can be expected from the Oxford student, the City banker or the Polish shop owner.\nIn this situation – I have argued e.g. here, here or here – public and controversial debates about EU issues become increasingly likely. And I have also argued that this is not a bad thing per se. Moving supranational decision-making into the public spotlight gives also those groups a say that are by now not so well represented at the office and negotiation tables in Brussels. If their arguments and preferences become visible in public debates about European integration, it will be much clearer which kind of EU and which supranational policies are actually acceptable in the affected collectives.\nBut we should also not be naïve, politicisation will not automatically equal an enlightened debate. Indeed, most of the recent research emphasizes that EU politicisation often favours right-wing populists and can quickly deteriorate into a tyranny of the majority over well-balanced processes (good starting points are here, here and here). The UK referendum process we have just observed unfortunately supports this: particularly the ‘Leave’ campaigners successfully invoked diffuse cultural threats and addressed the gut feelings rather than the rational interests of those feeling left behind by the EU.\nIt did not matter whether the numbers on Boris’ bus were fact or fairy tale. A plummeting FTSE as well as revolting entrepreneurs and companies did not challenge the promise of more jobs and higher incomes in a UK outside of the EU. It did not matter that no ‘leave’ leader had to explain how the UK could maintain single market access without buying into the full set of rules. In sum, the ‘leave’ leaders actually saw no need to specify any meaningful economic or political alternatives. So while the Eurosceptic campaign successfully built on the not completely unjustified collywobbles of the worker, the fisherman and the old lady, it did not offer any substantial remedy or clue on how the lives of these people would improve without the EU.\nSo it is easy to blame demagoguery (or the half-hearted responses from the ‘remain’ campaign). But we cannot expect that self-righteous populists will take responsibility. Rather we should be reminded that voters are responsible, too – they took the ultimate decision. The lack of reasonable political alternatives for their country outside of the EU was apparently not a significant obstacle to voting ‘leave’. It seems, casting a simple protest vote against the political establishment in London and Brussels was motivation enough to make this fundamental choice.\nThis leaves us with actually very little to learn about the voters’ sincere EU and policy preferences. But thus repeating or circumventing the referendum is equally wrong. If one buys that European integration has created some societal losers that will have to be compensated at some stage, if one buys that containing public EU politicisation is highly unlikely in this context, and if one buys that so far mainly irresponsible populists have gained from politicisation, any attempt to sneak around the referendum outcome perpetuates protest voting against the EU. In contrast, now accepting the majority vote in last weeks’ referendum sends a clear message to UK and EU citizens. It says: your choices do count, but this power comes with responsibility. It says: your vote is consequential, but not only for the political establishment but also for your very own life circumstances. This is not about punishing British voters for what I – personally – consider a wrong decision. Rather, it is about empowering them. In the light of equally irresponsible and populist platforms in various democracies, voters in Europe and beyond should be strongly encouraged to evaluate their options wisely.\nSo while I think that the BREXIT decision is wrong, I am deeply convinced that it should now be implemented quickly. We are in a game of poker with the Johnson, Hofer, and Wilders types, and if we don’t call their bluffs as early as possible, we risk losing the whole evening."

    "text": "This post originally appeared in the December 2015 issue of the WZB-Mitteilungen.\nBig Data has become a ubiquitous buzzword. Social networks, smartphones, and various online applications and websites constantly produce and provide information on an unprecedented scale and level of detail. Data storage is cheap and ever-improving analytical tools seem to herald a revolution in the way we understand the world. Some argue that this also fundamentally transforms science. Just crunching more data, it is assumed, allows us to take better decisions and solve social and political problems. So is the Big Data revolution the end of the social sciences as we know them?\nWe contend that it is not. As social scientists we are particularly well trained to know that observations alone – no matter how many of them there are – hardly lead to meaningful inferences without carefully specifying the underlying assumptions and constructing valid research designs. It is the combination between the principles of social scientific inquiry with novel methods of automated data generation and processing that bears the potential to generate new insights into socially relevant questions."

    "text": "Don’t believe the hype – at least not all of it\nThe bold statements on the transformative power of the Big Data revolution are often rooted in rather naïve views on data analysis and largely unclear specifications of what Big Data actually is. One major pitfall is the belief – popular amongst computer scientists, Internet pundits and data journalists – that Big Data signals the end of theory. Corresponding arguments essentially equate Big Data with an N=all approach in which simple correlations reveal the ultimate truth about the world. For social scientists this clearly misses a crucial point: data is meaningful only with regards to a particular theory and we need to explicate the assumptions that drive our conclusions. Theory influences and even determines what we observe in a given data set, which aspects or phenomena we identify as relevant, and how we distinguish spurious correlations from causally meaningful relationships. Google’s search routines, for example, are built on the assumption that more incoming links indicate higher importance of a website. You might or might not buy into this assumption, but you should be aware of it when interpreting the results.\nA related pitfall is reducing Big Data only to really, really large data sets. In the social sciences we judge the number (and the composition) of our observations relative to the population of interest. The Big Data hype usually invokes images of the billions of observations that e.g. social media produce. But individuals select themselves into these networks – do all of your friends use Twitter? – and if we ignore these processes we might quickly draw skewed conclusions. In other, socially equally relevant, areas – such as the political commitment to international treaties discussed below – a comparatively modest number of observations might already represent the universe of cases quite well. From a social science point of view, there is simply no absolute criterion for drawing the line between ‘big’ and ‘small’ data without having a specific social phenomenon in mind. And accordingly, big and small data are subject to the same analytical challenges when it comes to measurement validity or selection bias. The modern social sciences have developed an encompassing toolkit to draw valid inferences from observational data – and with the abundance of digitally available information this asset has become more rather than less important.\nFrom our perspective, thus, Big Data does not put an end to the scientific method – but it holds significant potential to enhance it: What we indeed consider as ‘revolutionary’ is the ever expanding set of methods to automatically collect, process, and analyze digital information. In various research fields, these methods can help us in systematically analyzing only loosely structured data sources such as websites or text documents. Big Data, in other words, provides inexpensive and timesaving means to tap uncharted sources of empirical evidence. Combined with explicit theory and sound social scientific methods, these innovative and replicable means of data collection and analysis contribute to answering substantial questions."

    "text": "Analyzing politics beyond the nation state with big data technologies\nThe study of international and supranational politics is probably not the first research area that comes to mind in the context of Big Data. Still, two examples from our own research are well suited to exemplify the potential of Big Data methods.\nThe first example concerns a central question in international relations research: do demanding legal obligations encourage or discourage the ratification of international treaties by states? Past scholarship has produced equivocal findings, because it analyzed only subsets of relevant treaties; as a result, the question remains unresolved.\nThe usual expectation is that states ignore demanding treaties in order to retain their freedom of action. We argue, however, that this decision varies with the substantive issue area a treaty covers. Where tougher treaty rules do commit oneself and especially other states to a specific course of action (e.g. reduction of air pollution, lower trade barriers), states should be more willing to sign onto more demanding obligations. When demanding treaty obligations mainly constrain one’s own freedom of action without binding others, more demanding obligations discourage ratification. The latter mechanism prevails in international human rights law, while the former applies in areas where inter-state cooperation is needed to provide common public goods (e.g. clean air, security).\nOur research question and theory inform our data choices: we need to capture individual states’ willingness for treaty ratification, here measured by the time needed to take this step, to isolate issue areas and their treaties from each another, and to seize the entire variation in demanding treaty obligations therein. We are quickly confronted with several thousand observations if we consider each of the 193 states for about 80 treaties from human rights and environmental regulation over the past 50 years.\nThis calls for Big Data methods. Accordingly, we program and implement a webscraping algorithm in the programming language Python to automatically extract and reshape data from the United Nations Treaty Collection Database. Within 2,5 minutes we gather around 140,000 observations. Speed is, though, not the only advantage. To isolate demanding obligations, we exploit the fact that different types of treaties, which regulate the same set of rights, differ only in their degree of obligations. Framework conventions impose fewer obligations on states than their optional protocols. The Python algorithm automatically recognizes the type of treaty and then codes our demandingness indicator. In the statistical analysis of these data, we provide consistent evidence in support of our argument and resolve the question about demanding obligations.\nThe second example from our current research focuses on EU affairs in national parliaments. To the extent that parliaments provide publically visible debates about the EU, they might dampen democratic deficits of supranational policy-making. While some argue that the incentives to politicize EU issues have increased with each transfer of political competences to the supranational level, others claim that selective partisan incentives drive public emphasis of EU topics. Extant research restricts itself to selected parliamentary debates where explicit EU questions figure on the formal agenda – ignoring the fact that the EU provides constraints and opportunities almost over the entire range of domestic issues possibly discussed in parliament.\nFor a systematic evaluation of these competing claims, we need information on the parliamentary salience of EU affairs over time across various issue areas, different levels of EU authority, and different settings of domestic partisan competition. To meet these considerable informational requirements, we scrape all plenary protocols between 1991 and 2013 from the document server of the German Bundestag. Using our method of automated pattern recognition, we split these texts into more than 148,000 individual speeches by parliamentarians from all parties. Finally, we count all term-level references to the policies, politics, and polity of the EU in each speech with a dictionary-based text-mining algorithm implemented in the R environment.\nThe data reveal that the amount of EU references in the German Bundestag has indeed systematically increased with each consecutive revision of EU treaties. Our results are robust to the inclusion of partisan differences and other control variables. Whether this holds beyond the German case remains to be seen and we currently extend this data collection strategy to other parliaments in EU member states.\nBig Data is what we make of it\nBig Data alone is hardly a panacea for all challenges modern societies face. If no meaningful theory is leveraged to contextualize and make sense of the abundant information, we at best only stare at huge piles of numbers. At worst, we infer policy recommendations from spurious correlations and skewed samples. That’s why the social sciences should make their voice heard in the current debates. Big Data does not end theory. It rather highlights the need for social scientists to critically reflect and give meaning to the massive flows of digits.\nBut this also requires that the social sciences open up to Big Data technologies. First, we should be able to understand the assumptions that drive modern algorithms when assessing their societal implications. Second, we can make technologies such as webscraping, pattern recognition, and text mining part of our methodological toolkit in order to save time and other costs involved in procuring the information we need for the questions we consider relevant. Big data will not transform the social sciences, but we have a lot to add to and a lot to gain from the technologies that it offers."

    "text": "“That’s good work”, a senior scholar commented publicly during one of my first-ever academic evaluations, “but why didn’t it appear in the top-top journals of the discipline?”. He went on to list the three journals with the highest Web-of-Science impact factors in political science. Below that nothing noteworthy seemed to exist.\nHonestly, this somewhat dismissive comment bugged me a bit at the time. After all I was lucky enough to have gotten my first papers into those journals that I read myself (and that happened to rank in the top-10 by the IF measure the evaluator seems to resort to). They also had started to collect quite a few citations by other scholars whose work I admired. But apparently that wasn’t “top-top” enough.\n In later academic evaluation processes (sometimes also sitting on the other side of the table), I observed that this simple heuristic usually pops up very quickly – the work of a researcher, of groups or projects, or even of whole institutes is assessed by whether their work was in the top-3 or sometimes top-5 impact factor journals on whatever disciplinary list was considered most suitable.\nThis heuristic irritates me time and again. To be sure, I agree that publishing and influencing debates are key criteria for scholarly success. But even without getting started on the usual complaints about erratic review processes, potential Zeitgeitst-biases, and varying audience sizes, narrowing the benchmark to a very few selected outlets and especially the inference from aggregated impact factors to individual manuscripts or authors continues to annoy me.\nThis hold in particular when this heuristic is pushed by quantitatively well-versed colleagues. Journal impact factors, after all, represent average values. And we hardly would get a paper published in a “top-top” journal if it would just draw inferences by looking at averages only. Averages are very sensitive to outliers and we usually would ask for more information about the underlying distribution – e.g. the standard deviation around the observed average. And we would be particularly sceptical about using the average as a comparative benchmark or the basis for inference when dealing with non-symmetric (=skewed) data distributions.\nBut rare outliers, large standard deviations, and skewed distributions is exactly what one would expect from the citation counts that make up journal impact factors: Amongst other things, we know about the prevalence of name-recognition dynamics and “Matthew effects” in scientific publishing for a long time (Merton 1968).\nBut then, the averages that the impact factors represent are hardly informative for comparing journals and especially for drawing inferences about individual manuscripts within these journals. \n\n\nWhen preparing an upcoming group evaluation, I wanted to make these points clear for my team. I thus collected citation counts for all manuscripts published over the last five years in those political science journals that were considered as leading along their current 5-year impact factor. The plots below show this journal list in descending order of IF and illustrate the distribution of individual manuscripts’ citation counts as densities and jittered dot plots.\n  \n\nWe clearly see that most journals – especially those at the top of the ranking - feature rare but strong outliers of highly cited manuscripts. Those affect the impact factors disproportionately which also means that the average provides little information about most manuscripts in that journal.\nWe also see that the distributions are heavily right-skewed in most cases – the overarching majority of manuscripts receives much less citations than the what the average impact factor would suggest.\nMoreover, the modes of the citation distributions across journals vary in a much narrower range than their averages. If we were to randomly pick two manuscripts from, say, the third-ranked journal and from the tenth-ranked journal, their citations counts would probably be not that different.\nAccordingly, there is no particularly strong relationship of a journal’s impact factor and the citation counts of individual manuscripts therein.\n \nIn short, the “top-top journal” heuristic seems to be rather flawed when it comes to inferring the (citation) impact of individual manuscripts (and their authors). Please avoid that simple shortcut when assessing the work of your peers.  \n\n\n\nOf course, criticizing the evaluation criteria is hardly a winning strategy while you are being assessed. But to nevertheless preempt this overly simple heuristic in our particular case, I used the evaluation report to indirectly flag the idea that manuscripts make impact factors (and not the other way around). To this end I collected citation counts for all works published by our group in the evaluation period, pooled them into a fictitious journal, and then ranked this journal relative to the other journals in political science and international relations (resorting to Google Scholar data and classification schemes). That message was well received …\n\n \nUpdate May 2024: In another evaluation I signed responsible for (sigh…), I pushed this idea further by also asking whether our publications actually have a positive effect on the impact factors of the journals that they appear in …"

    "text": "Spätestens seit dem russischen Angriff auf die Ukraine häufen sich die Vorwürfe an die Europäische Union, dass sie in den Jahren zuvor nicht genug klare Kante gegenüber Russland gezeigt habe. Lassen sich diese Vorwürfe belegen? Zur Beantwortung dieser Frage haben die Autoren sämtliche Reden von EU-Mitgliedstaaten vor der Vollversammlung der Vereinten Nationen bis 2020 analysiert. Das Bild ist nicht gerade vorteilhaft.\nDer russische Angriff auf die Ukraine markierte die Rückkehr von Gewalt in die zuletzt von Handel, Vernetzung und Verrechtlichung geprägte Politik auf dem europäischen Kontinent. Die anschließende Verurteilung und Sanktionierung Russlands in Europa wurde von politischen Beobachtern weithin begrüßt; gleichwohl zeigten sich viele auch überrascht von der großen Einigkeit des „Westens“ und vor allem der EU-Mitgliedstaaten. Denn die Europäische Union wird bis heute trotz ihrer großen ökonomischen Bedeutung oft als außenpolitischer Zwerg wahrgenommen. Die divergierenden Interessen der Mitgliedstaaten und die mangelnde Institutionalisierung außenpolitischer Koordination führten immer wieder zu dem Eindruck, dass die Union nur unklare und bestenfalls schwache Signale an die Weltöffentlichkeit sende.\nDies gilt auch mit Blick auf die Ukraine. Die unklare Positionierung der EU in Reaktion auf frühere russische Aggressionen – man denke an den zerstörerischen zweiten Tschetschenienkrieg, die brutalen Interventionen in Georgien und Syrien sowie insbesondere die militärische Annexion der Krim – könnten, so der Vorwurf vieler politischer Kommentare, Putin zu der Erwartung verleitet haben, dass sich die politischen und wirtschaftlichen Folgen eines Angriffs in Grenzen halten würden. Nun wird vermutlich im Dunkeln bleiben, was am Ende den Ausschlag für Putins Kriegsentscheidung gegeben hat. Aber wir können untersuchen, ob es die vermutete europäische Zurückhaltung wirklich gegeben hat. Lässt es sich nachweisen, dass es die EU-Mitgliedstaaten versäumt haben, sich mit deutlichen geeinten Signalen gegen frühere russische Aggressionen zu positionieren?\nWir sind dieser Frage auf Basis eines Volltextkorpus nachgegangen, der alle Reden vor der Vollversammlung der Vereinten Nationen bis 2020 enthält. In diesem zentralen Forum der Weltpolitik haben alle Regierungen jedes Jahr die Chance, ihre außenpolitischen Prioritäten und Positionierungen vor der Weltöffentlichkeit kundzutun. Die Reden von EU-Mitgliedstaaten auf dieser Bühne enthalten also wertvolle Informationen über die Konsistenz und Stärke der Signale von der EU an Russland im Zeitverlauf. Wir extrahieren diese Informationen mit modernen Algorithmen der natürlichen Sprachverarbeitung. Im ersten Schritt nutzen wir ein ‚semantic role labelling‘-Verfahren, um alle Sätze zu identifizieren, in denen Russland (bzw. die Sowjetunion als dessen Vorgängerstaat) als handelnder Akteur benannt wird.\nIm zweiten Schritt skalieren wir die Sprache dieser Sätze mit einem Wortvektormodell entlang ihrer semantischen Ähnlichkeit zu konfliktbetonten und kooperativen Begriffen in der diplomatischen Kommunikation (u.a. z.B. ‚Feind/Freund‘, ‚Krieg/Frieden‘, ‚aggressiv/kooperativ‘ usw.). Eine Zufallsstichprobe von 150 Sätzen zeigt, dass sich diese Skalierung weitgehend mit der Interpretation zweier menschlicher Kodierer deckt.\n\n\n\nDie folgende Abbildung fasst zusammen, was uns dieser Ansatz über die Signale aller EU-Mitgliedsstaaten in Richtung Russland im Zeitverlauf verrät.\n\n\n\nEU-Mitgliedsstaaten haben Russland bzw. die Sowjetunion vor allem nach der Invasion in Afghanistan 1979 und der darauffolgenden letzten Hochphase des Kalten Kriegs als handelnden Akteur auf der Weltbühne benannt. Diese Signale waren nicht nur häufig, sondern auch stark konfliktbetont. Teilweise liegen die Werte unseres Skalierungsmodels fast drei Standardabweichungen unter der durchschnittlichen Konflikthaftigkeit der fast einer Million gesprochenen Sätze in der UN-Vollversammlung.\nDies ändert sich schlagartig mit dem kurz nach dem Austritt der Ukraine erfolgten Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion 1991. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt sprachen EU-Mitliedstaaten vor der UN deutlich seltener über Russland. Und wenn sie es taten, sandten sie klar kooperative Signale. Für unsere Frage besonders bedeutsam: An diesem schwach kooperativen Signal der EU-Mitglieder an Russland änderte weder der erste noch der zweite Tschetschenienkrieg etwas. Nach den verheerenden Bildern des zerbombten Grosny im Jahr 2000 schweigen EU-Regierungen in diesem zentralen Forum der Weltpolitik gegenüber Russland und senden ab 2003 sogar wieder vereinzelt kooperative Signale. In einer Welt, in der politische Rhetorik abschreckenden Charakter durch klare Positionierungen haben kann, kommt das Schweigen auf dieser zentralen Weltbühne einem Signal der Gleichgültigkeit nahe.\nDie internationale Kommunikation der EU-Staaten dreht sich erst langsam mit der russischen Intervention im Kaukasuskrieg 2008 und dann vor allem mit der Annexion der Krim 2014 und der Intervention in Syrien 2015. Die rhetorische Priorisierung von Russland als handelndem Akteur nimmt in EU-Reden wieder deutlich zu und tendiert im Mittel zu eher konfliktbetonten Signalen.\nWar die Krim also der notwendige Weckruf, den es brauchte, damit die Regierungen der EU sich zu einer gemeinsamen internationalen Kommunikation an und über Russland aufrafften? Nicht wirklich. Im Vergleich zur Hochphase des Kalten Krieges sprach man ab 2014 immer noch nicht sonderlich häufig über Russland– insbesondere, wenn man bedenkt, dass sich die Anzahl an EU-Mitgliedsstaaten seit den 1980-er Jahren fast verdoppelt hat. Zudem sehen wir eine hohe Bandbereite in der Art, wie EU-Staaten über Russland sprechen: In den drei auf die Krim-Annexion folgenden Jahren finden wir immer noch viele Statements in einer tendenziell kooperativen Sprache. Die folgende Abbildung verdeutlicht, dass dies an einer Divergenz zwischen den einzelnen EU-Regierungen liegt.\n\n\n\nSie zeigt zunächst, dass nur 20 der damals noch 28 EU-Mitgliedstaaten Russland in ihrer jährlich wichtigsten außenpolitischen Rede überhaupt als Akteur benannt haben. Der Großteil dieser Regierungen hat das in den sechs hier beobachten Jahren auch nur ein einziges Mal getan. Und sie setzen Russland dabei oft auch in einen eher kooperativen Kontext – etwa in den wenigen Statements der Regierungen von Luxemburg, der Slowakei oder Ungarn.\nDie Regierungen der als führende EU-Nationen verstandenen Staaten Deutschland und Frankreich benannten Russland zwar etwas häufiger als Akteur, nutzten dies aber, um im Mittel eher neutrale bzw. tendenziell kooperative Botschaften zu senden.\nKlare Ausreißer sind hingegen die zwischen Russland und Weißrussland eingeklemmten Staaten Litauen und Lettland: Die Regierungen dieser Staaten sprechen vor der UN seit der Krim-Annexion überdurchschnittlich häufig über Russland und benutzen dabei eine deutlich konfliktbetontere Sprache.\nInsgesamt stützten die von uns aufgedeckten sprachlichen Muster das Bild einer zwar wirtschaftspolitisch mächtigen Europäischen Union, die es aber als Block auf der Weltbühne lange nicht vermocht hat, mit geeinten und klaren Signalen auf einen internationalen Aggressor zu reagieren. Wir wissen natürlich nicht, ob diese widersprüchlichen Signale Putins Kalkulation über den Preis des Angriffs auf die Ukraine wirklich beeinflusst haben. Aber es spricht einiges dafür – und allein dies sollte die EU ausreichend motivieren, auch in Zukunft auf der Weltbühne mit Einigkeit und klaren Signalen für ihre Werte einzutreten.\n\nLiteratur\n\nBaturo, A., Dasandi, N., & Mikhaylov, S.

    "text": "I recently often find myself in discussions about the extent to which academics can and should contribute to public (often meaning: mediatized) debates or even actual consultation of policy-makers (at my current institution particularly triggered by this, in the otherwise rather dozy German Political Science Association hotly debated here).\nThus the recently published ‘F.A.Z. Ökonomeneranking’, which annually crowns the top 100 ‘most influential’ German-speaking economists, caught my interest: it aims to combine measures for both public and academic impact.\nAcademic impact is measured by the count of Scopus citations in the last four years, media impact is captured by named references in the German-speaking print and radio press during the last year, and political impact is retrieved from references in a survey that asked German MPs and government officials (n=89) for their sources of economic guidance (more detail here). I scraped the raw data table and played with it a bit. Here’s what I found:   \nNot much, essentially. In contrast to some of the arguments frequently invoked in the discussions with my colleagues, the different ‘spheres’ of academic impact seem hardly related. Neither is there evidence for a trade-off between scholarly impact on the one hand, and public or political presence on the other (often heard by those particularly successful on the former dimension). Nor is there evidence that scholarly impact is a sort of necessary condition for influence in public and political debates (often the lowest-common denominator agreement from a somewhat more normative perspective).\nSo, what do you read from this? And is there comparable data for political scientists?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This PADEMIA training workshop focuses on methodological and practical considerations in the rigorous analysis of parliamentary democracy in Europe. It addresses the different forms and shapes of the discourses produced in and by parliaments. This ranges from transcripts of plenary debates and committee reports to media and online resonance of parliamentary affairs. These empirically observable outputs of parliamentary activity come mostly as written documents but also in the form of live streams and other vehicles amenable to systematic content analysis methods. We thus discuss the methodological challenges in approaching this wealth of empirical material, including most notably concerns about sampling as well as the reliability and validity of measurement instruments.\nThe workshop aims to allow doctoral students of parliamentary affairs in Europe to exchange ideas and discuss their research with their peers and senior academic colleagues with a particular focus on methodological options, techniques and practical considerations. To this end it is organised around alternating teaching and presentation sessions.\nThe teaching sessions condense the basic methodological parameters of content analysing the products of parliamentary democracy and will discuss the promises and pitfalls of specific methodological approaches - ranging from human coding, particularly in the form of representative claims analysis, to various forms of automated text analysis. For each session some indicative background literature will be provided to the participants. In the paper sessions, the participants will present their own research projects. The presentation should mainly focus on the purpose of content analyses in the particular project. We kindly ask the presenters to discuss the key concepts (to be) measured, the sampled documents, the methodological options considered and the practical challenges that the analyses face. The presentations should not exceed 20 mins and will be followed by 20 mins group discussion. To get the most out of the workshop for all participants, we expect that everybody has read the submitted project papers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll details on course organization, assignments, literature and individual sessions are provided in the syllabus below."

The first two sessions offer general introductions to the fundamentals of content analyses.

Based on short introductions to these methods, these latter sessions will primarily revolve around the discussion of your corresponding research projects.\nAlong this line I expect a thorough study of the obligatory literature before the workshop, an active participation during the workshop and one presentation per participant.

Speeches, debates, position papers, press releases, traditional and social media coverage, as well as the resulting laws, agreements, or resolutions can tell us much on the priorities, preferences, and power of political actors.

For studying international politics across long time periods or broad actor sets, political text is often the only consistently available information source that we have. The challenge, however, lies in extracting systematic information from largely unstructured texts in a reliable and systematic fashion. This is a promise of automated content analyses: various algorithms offer means to reveal relevant patterns in the vast amount of political language that we can nowadays access in digital formats.\nThe block seminar thus introduces the strengths but also the limitations of various approaches to treat text as data.

Prior knowledge in content analysis or quantitative methods is not required but may be an asset. The seminar pursues three related teaching goals:\n\nEnable students to read and to assess studies using automated text analyses\nAllow informed methodological choices and provide pragmatic tips/resources for conducting own text analyses\nCreate awareness for the more general promises and pitfalls of analysing human language with automated algorithms \n\nSuccessful participants will be awarded with 4 ECTS.

Reden und Presserklärungen, Debatten und Parteiprogramme, Gesetze und Positionspapiere oder aber Zeitungsberichte und Blogs verraten viel über inhaltliche Prioritäten, Positionen und die Macht politischer Akteure. Solche Texte liefern die relevante Information aber häufig nur in unstrukturierter und interpretationsbedürftiger Form. Das Seminar bietet den TeilnehmerInnen deshalb einen einführenden Überblick zu Methoden, mit denen sie systematische, vergleichende Informationen zu eigenen Fragestellungen aus größeren Textmengen gewinnen können.\nDer Kurs gliedert sich dazu in drei Blöcke. In einem ersten Teil besprechen wir die Grundlagen der Inhalts- und insbesondere der Textanalyse anhand einzelner Lehrbuchkapitel. Themen sind der Aufbau eines typischen Forschungsprojekts, das Sampling relevanter Texte, mögliche Kodierungsverfahren und die Qualitätskriterien inhaltsanalytischer Forschungsdesigns. Im zweiten Block geht es dann um klassische politikwissenschaftliche Anwendungen von Inhaltsanalysenanalysen etwa zur Parteienpositionierung, zur Salienz politischer Themen oder zur Gewinnung von Protestdaten aus der Medienberichterstattung. Darauf aufbauend werden im dritten Block moderne Verfahren zur (halb-) automatisierten Textanalyse vorgestellt, mit denen aktuell etwa der Einfluss von Interessengruppen, der Wandel politischer Interpretationsmuster oder aber die Salienz internationaler Politik in nationalen Parlamentsdebatten untersucht wird.\nDie TeilnehmerInnen erörtern so die Stärken und Schwächen einzelner Ansätze an konkreten Beispielen und erhalten zudem praktische Tipps zu relevanten Analyseverfahren, Datenquellen und Werkzeugen."

    "text": "Kursorganisation und Leistungsnachweise\n\nDer Kurs richtet sich an fortgeschrittene Bachelorstudierende, die erste Kenntnisse in quantitativen politikwissenschaftlichen Methoden und Forschungsdesigns vertiefen wollen und ggf. eigene Inhalts- oder Textanalyseprojekte anstreben. Teilnahmevoraussetzungen sind die regelmäßige vorbereitende Auseinandersetzung mit der zumeist englischsprachigen Pflichtliteratur, die aktive Mitwirkung sowie mindestens eine Präsentation eines wissenschaftlichen Aufsatzes. Für einen Leistungsschein ist zudem eine Hausarbeit verlangt, in der entweder ein textanalytisches Projekt fachlich kritisiert oder aber ein eigenes textanalytisches Forschungsdesign zu einer selbstgewählten Fragestellung – etwa zur Vorbereitung von Bachelorarbeiten – entwickelt wird.\nDa wir uns in diesem Semester nicht physisch treffen können, wird das Seminar in einer digitalen Umgebung durchgeführt. Trotzdem ist der Anspruch der gleiche: Ich möchte (a) Sie mit der gegenwärtigen Forschungsagenda vertraut machen, (b) sicherstellen, dass wir voneinander lernen können, indem es Raum für Ihre Fragen, Kommentare und Kritik gibt, und (c) auch eine faire Bewertung Ihrer Leistungen möglich machen. Unser primärer „Treffpunkt“ wird die Seminar-Website auf dem FU-Blackboard sein. Dort wird das Seminar entlang folgender Parameter organisiert:\nIhr wöchentliches Selbststudium entlang der Pflichtliteratur für jede Sitzung (siehe Abschnitt C unten)\n\nEine wöchentliche kurze Videovorlesung (ppt Voiceover, asynchron, jeweils bis spätestens Donnerstag) von mir, die Sie durch die wichtigsten Argumente und Schwachstellen der Pflichtliteratur führt.\nEin offenes Diskussionsforum, in dem jeder Teilnehmer Fragen und Beobachtungen teilen kann (und sollte) und gleichzeitig Kommentare zu denen der anderen Teilnehmer liefert. Bitte überprüfen Sie dieses Board mindestens wöchentlich,\nZwei Videokonferenzen (KW23 und KW29), die vermutlich über WebEx organisiert werden\nZusammenfassung von mindestens einer wissenschaftlichen Studie (siehe Abschnitt C unten), der die Präsentation ersetzt. Diese Zusammenfassung sollte die Forschungsfrage und Befunde der Studie vorstellen, diskutieren warum und wie ein inhaltsanalytisches Verfahren gewählt wurde und dieses dann anhand der im Seminar entwickelten Kriterien kritisieren. Analog zu einer Präsentation wird das Ergebnis über Blackboard allen Teilnehmern zur Verfügung gestellt. Ich akzeptiere die folgenden Formate:\n\nSelbstaufgezeichnete Video- oder Audiopräsentation (z. B. ppt Voiceover)\nWissenschaftliches Poster\nSchriftliche Zusammenfassung (pdf) von ca. 2000-3000 Wörtern\n\nIndividuell vereinbarte Kontakte per E-Mail und / oder Skype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll details on course organization, assignments, literature and individual sessions are provided in the syllabus below."
